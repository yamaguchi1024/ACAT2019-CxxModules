\begin{abstract}
ROOT has several features which interact with libraries and require implicit header inclusion. This can be triggered by reading or writing data on disk, or user actions at the prompt. Often, the headers are immutable and reparsing is redundant. C++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of the same header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of C++ Code. ROOT has released a C++ Modules-aware technology preview which intends to become the default for the next release.

In this paper, we will summarize our experience with migrating C++ Modules to LHC experiment's software code bases. We outline the challenges in C++ Modules migration of the CMS software, including integration of C++ Modules support in CMS build system. We also evaluate the performance benefits that experiments are expected to achieve.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

In High Energy Physics (HEP), experiments such as LHC \cite{lhc} produces a large amount of data each seconds, and we expect to have even more data in Hi-lumi LHC \cite{hilumi} era. Thus software for HEP are always striving to archive the better performance, which will result in the reduction of costs in data centers as well as easing physicists waiting for their job to be processed.

ROOT~\cite{root} is a core software used in High Energy Physics (HEP) not only for data analysis, but also as a backend for larger LHC experiment's software such as CMSSW and ATLAS. Thus the performance improvement in ROOT will result in also improving experiment's software, which requires more resources than ROOT itself.

C++ Modules \cite{vassil-paper} has been supported in ROOT since version 6.16, in order to improve its performance. The cost of header re-parsing can be negligible in small to medium size codebases, but can be  high in larger codebases. Usually, the scalability issues arise at compile-time and do not affect the programs at runtime. However, ROOT is different -- its C++ interpreter Cling processes code at program execution time and avoidance of redundant content re-parsing yields better runtime performance.

C++ Modules represent the compiler internal state serialized on disk and deserialized on demand to avoid repetitions of parsing operations, as we have described in \cite{chep-modules}. There are different implementations of the concept in Clang, GCC and MSVC. ROOT uses Clang through its interpreter Cling and adopts the C++ Modules implementation in Clang, which is one of the most sophisticated on the market as of today.

Many operations in ROOT require loading a shared library and its corresponding header files. For example when we serialize or deserialize a ROOT file, ROOT needs to know which library contains how to stream the object. This meta information is widely known as ROOT "dictionary" information. The dictionary is generated by a platform-independent tool, \textit{rootcling}, which processes ROOT-aware code and produces C++ source code file with a prefix \textit{G\_\_}. The file is later compiled and linked into the library it describes.

Generally, there are two ways to load a library: implicitly or explicitly. Both models require the library description to be available before or no later than library loading time. That is, all header files describing the library should be processed by the interpreter blindly without knowing if they will be used. This is a severe performance bottleneck which ROOT addresses with several technologies: \textit{ROOTMAP}s, \textit{RDICT}s and a \textit{PCH}. The ROOTMAP file represents a lightweight version of the library descriptor containing forward declarations and their mapping to the corresponding library. The RDICT file represents a cache of a subset of \textit{TClass} objects which will be created when the library is loaded. The PCH file contains almost all of the headers in ROOT in an optimized form which is loaded at start up to avoid header re-parsing.

The ROOTMAPs and RDICTs are home-grown fixes to the inherent PCH problem -- it is impossible to extend a PCH without fully recompiling it. C++ Modules are the industry solution to this problem -- they represent composable PCH files called \textit{PCM}s.

A PCM is generated by rootcling using a special file containing the mapping between a header file and the module to be created, called a \textit{modulemap} file. It describes how a collection of existing headers corresponds to the logical structure of a module. It is important to note that transitive includes not present in a modulemap file are persisted multiple times. That is, if \textit{A.h} includes \textit{C.h}, \textit{B.h} includes \textit{C.h} and the modulemap maps A.h to module \textit{Alpha} and B.h to module \textit{Beta}, the content of C.h will be duplicated in both Modules. Such duplication can reduce performance dramatically and should be avoided at almost any cost. This important detail suggest that "modularization" should be done bottom-up, namely, starting from external dependencies onward.

Third-party code can work in mixed mode with ROOT with enabled C++ Modules. For instance, the dictionaries of CMSSW can use the old dictionary system while the dictionaries of ROOT use the new technology. Ultimately, this will not manifest into performance improvements because the C++ Modules technology intends to address dictionaries outside of the ROOT PCH, namely, in third-party software. The mixed mode support ensures an incremental migration path while having a stable system throughout the migration period.

CMS \cite{cms} is one of the largest experiment in LHC and performance improvement of its software is crucial for the coming HL-LHC. CMS experiment develops their software stack called CMSSW (CMS SoftWare)[FIXME: CITE CMSSW WEBSITE or PAPER] which uses ROOT as its backend.

CMSSW utilizes their own build system, SCRAM \cite{scram}. SCRAM is a configuration management tool, a distribution system, a build system and a resource manager, with local resources and applications managed in a transparent way. Enabling C++ Modules in SCRAM is a crucial part of the project.

% TODO: reference the CMSSW diagram
In CMSSW, SCRAM build system resolves library dependencies and executes and also C++ compiler such as gcc ROOT Genreflex, which is a wrapper of rootcling. Rootcling generates CMS ROOT dictionaries, rootmaps and RDICTs, as it was in ROOT. At the same time gcc compiles C++ files and generates CMS shared object libraries. 

\section{Migrating CMSSW to C++ Modules}
\label{migration}

%FIXME: In CMSSW, SCRAM generates modulemap for only libraries which has --cxxmodule flag enabled. it iterates through interface/ directory, add header files in them and automatically generates classes.h. Generate modulemap, pcms, and load them.
Modularizing CMSSW requires two steps: generating a modulemap file and enabling C++ Modules in \textit{rootcling}. The generation of modulemap file happens at configuration time where we produce a file describing each library as a module and each library header file as a submodule. This can be subtle in some build systems as it requires tracking of header files which usually is not required. SCRAM already supports this and it was trivial to synthesize that description. Enabling C++ Modules in rootcling is done by adding an extra \textit{-cxxmodule} flag. We started doing that gradually library-by-library to avoid unnecessary complications.

This section describes the steps taken in CMSSW in order to migrate fully to C++ Modules. We mention a few items of work which are complete, a few which are ongoing and in both cases the work was conducted by the authors but with significant support of our colleagues mentioned in section \ref{ack}.

\subsection{Header Sanitizing}
In most cases, a module corresponds to a single dictionary (or library). Each module enumerates every header file in a submodule. Each submodule needs to be able to compile in isolation. Illustratively, a separate compiler instance is run on each header file. This assumes that every header file should be able to compile on its own. \textit{Standalone} header files include what they use and are resilient to configuration macros.

CMSSW codebase had a lot of header files inaccuracies thoroughly described in the GitHub C++ Modules Meta Issue~\cite{Modules-gh-metaissue}. The issues can be classified into the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Incomplete headers -- header files which do not include what they use. They are easy to fix because the C++ Modules system usually is able to suggest which are the omitted includes;
    \item Broken headers -- header files which never compiled. Those header files were never included in any translation unit but were "part" of a library. They are easy to deprecate and remove;
    \item Cyclic headers -- header files whose include graph contains a cycle. For example, header \textit{A} includes header \textit{B} which includes \textit{A}. Header \textit{A} is in module \textit{Alpha} and header \textit{B} in \textit{Beta}. Usually this is a signal for a layering violation -- concepts from one library depend on another an vice versa. In many cases, using forward declarations of such entities resolve the problem. In some cases more sophisticated engineering techniques are necessary, such as, refactoring, moving the two dependent headers together or splitting the common dependent logic into its own library and module. In rare cases, if the mutual dependence of headers is by design they have to be in a single submodule.
    \item Macro headers -- header files which contain predominantly macro definitions which can be expanded differently in each translation unit. For example, \textit{$<$assert.h$>$} which conditionally defines the \textit{assert} if \textit{NDEBUG} is not defined. Macro headers are meant to be always textually included and they should be marked as \textit{textual headers} in the modulemap file. 
    \item Token generating headers -- header files which enable preprocessor metaprogramming should be excluded from the modulemap file.
\end{itemize}

After sanitizing the header files a toolchain to protect regressions can be introduced. In CMSSW every header in a pull request is checked for the aforementioned issues. This is done by precompiling each header on its own. In future we will deploy the include graph sanitization tool which we used to detect include cycles~\cite{scram-cycle-break}.

\subsection{Modularizing External Dependencies}

In order to fully see the expected performance benefits we should modularize external dependencies as well. An external dependency should be modularized if a module transitively includes it. For example if header \textit{A} from module \textit{Alpha} includes directly or indirectly \textit{$<$vector$>$}, the external library, \textit{libstdc++}, containing that file should be modularized.

It can be challenging to modularize external dependencies. On the one hand it may be difficult to know what the modulemap file should contain. On the other hand because they can be in a non-writable locations on the file system. We have prepared a set of modulemap files for all external dependencies of CMSSW~\cite{raphael-auto-Modules}. The second challenge is solved a file which instructs rootcling to pretend that the modulemap file is located at the non-writable folder in the file system. The \textit{virtual file system overlay file (VFSOF} can be automatically synthesized by~\cite{raphael-auto-Modules}.

\subsection{Automatic Generation of Modulemap Files and Virtual File System Overlays}

% This section is probably the most important section in this paper, as all other experiments' librarian wants to know how they can modularize their software stack.

% describe how scram generates modulemap here in deail. Also we can mention about classes.h
As was mentioned in the section \ref{intro}, one of important features to be adjusted is generation modulemaps. Well-behaved header files are trivial to enumerate in the modulemap file (as illustrated in listing~\ref{list:modulemap}). When libraries contain many headers it may be laborious to enumerate them by hand especially if the directory structure is flat. The modulemap file syntax allows easy automation and most of its content can be generated by a build system.

\begin{listing}[h]
\noindent
\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth}
\begin{cppcode*}{linenos=false}
module DataFormatsTrackerCommon_xr {
  module "TrackerTopology" {header "DataFormats/TrackerCommon/interface/TrackerTopology.h" export *}
  module "TrackerDetSide" {header "DataFormats/TrackerCommon/interface/TrackerDetSide.h" export *}
  module "ClusterSummary" {header "DataFormats/TrackerCommon/interface/ClusterSummary.h" export *}

  export *
}
\end{cppcode*}
\end{minipage}
\caption{An example of a C++ Module definition in the CMSSW modulemap file.}
\label{list:modulemap}
\end{listing}

Autogeneration of modulemap in CMSSW is quite simple. The codebase has the library interface headers files in a separate folders. We automatically generate the modulemap by iterating through those interface headers. It is expected that the modulemap is generated at configuration time but it must be generated no later then the first invocation of \textit{rootcling}.

The process of modularization subsumes external dependencies such as \textit{libc}, \textit{libstdc++} and \textit{libxml}. In most of the cases they are located in non-writable areas and modulemaps are impossible to add unless super user privileges are granted.

% FIXME!: put diagram for module maps here
Diagram \ref{fig:modulemap} shows the organization of C++ Modules infrastructure together with module map system. Blue rectangles describe the physical directories, purple rectangles physical files. Black thick arrows denote physical files. Dashed lines show the virtual file system relationship.

Modulemap files for libc and stl (libstdc++) need to be present in \textit{/usr/include} and \textit{/usr/include/c++} respectively. Listing~\ref{list:vfsof} illustrates how the VFSOF instructs the infrastructure to consider \textit{libc.modulemap} and \textit{stl.modulemap} as if they were physically present in the expected folders. This approach allows us to "mount" modulemap files anywhere on the system enabling full software stack modularization.

\section{Preliminary Performance Results}
\label{results}

The mixed run mode in ROOT allows us to make partial performance studies to assess the impact of this technology. The study was conducted on CMSSW build server, where all the CMS software is continuously integrated. As CMSSW is large and there exist huge variation of possible physics workflows, we measured a realistic CMS workflow tests which were expected to represent the actual code that physicists would run for their analysis.

Figure \ref{fig:performance1} shows the benchmark of CPU time and memory footprint. On every plot, CMSSW is built without C++ Modules (\textit{ROOT Master} as baseline. \textit{ROOT PCMs} is CMSSW built with ROOT only using its own C++ Modules (around 80) and other libraries don't have C++ Modules. \textit{CMS PCMs} is the configuration where ROOT and CMSSW runs with C++ Modules (around 90 due to the incomplete modularization).

\label{fig:performance1}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:perf:a}, \ref{fig:perf:b}, \ref{fig:perf:c} and \ref{fig:perf:d} do not show the expected improvements, however, they show no performance degradation which was the intent of the study at that stage of modularization. We miss performance improvement opportunities mainly due to two reasons: the incomplete modularization; and the preloading of all modules at startup time in sparse workflows.
 
 
%The work presented in this article shows that C++ Modules technology were successfully implemented and tested in ROOT and CMSSW software framework. The work on performance improvement is still ongoing. C++ Modules will provide experiments a benefit of header modularity of libraries and performance improvement.

\section{Conclusion}
We have shown the current advancements in the modularization of the CMSSW codebase. Despite of the partial migration we observed promising performance improvements. We are working towards modularization of the rest of the CMSSW components and external dependencies. We have implemented a set of tools to aid this process and we do not expect significant blockers.

We are working on a further memory footprint reductions by avoiding preloading of all modules at startup time. This requires global module content indexing and loading the corresponding modules on demand. We expect more sophisticated benchmarking to be done improving the coverage of many more workflows.
